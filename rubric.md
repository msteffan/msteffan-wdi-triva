Based on the these project results, I'm more than confident that you understand above and beyond the concepts that were covered in the first couple of weeks. Really nice job incorporating the smooth scroll jQuery plugin, I thought that was really cool.

## Creativity
The site looks really great! Very aesthetically  pleasing. Having lived in the pacific northwest for 3 years I definitely appreciated it!

## Code Quality
Code Quality was really great! Indentation is flawless and I can't praise you enough for the awesome commenting. Really makes it easy to code review when there's such meticulous code commenting.

## Problem Solving
I think you did a great job breaking this problem down into it's component parts. No struggles solving this problem domain at all that I saw.

## Total
2- exceeds expecations. The UI is pretty fluid and overall theme is really pleasing. I like that you tried doing an object oriented approach to this problem. Look at my comments in js/script.js to see what things you may be able to do to improve upon your current code base/design. I think you did a great job overall on this project though! Nice work.

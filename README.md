User stories

- As a user, I want to be able to select a category to play from a list, so that I can have a shot at answering correctly. (//have freedom of choice?)
- As a user, I want to see the question on my screen so that I can read it.
- As a user, I want to be able to type my answer to each question and press submit.
- As a user, I want to know how many questions I have answered correctly so far, so that I can gauge how well I'm doing.
- As a user, I want to know how many questions I have left in the category so that I know how much longer until the game ends.
- As a user, I want to know if a question is 'easy,' 'moderate,' or 'hard' so that I can gauge how whether I just don't know a lot about this topic or if the questions are disproportionately difficult.
- As a user, I want to know how well I did (questions right vs questions wrong), so that I can brag (hopefully) to my friends about how much I know.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the correct answers at the end of the game, so I can learn more facts and improve my score the next time I play.

slightly ambitious user stories

- As a user, I want to be able to select two-player mode (vs one-player mode), so that I can play trivia against a friend.
- As a user, I want to be able to compare my score for a category against a friend's score.
- As a user, I want to have a time limit on each question so that I can make the game harder if I want a bigger challenge.
